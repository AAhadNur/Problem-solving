Hello there, and welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to problem-solving! My name is Abdul Ahad, and I'm a software developer with a passion for challenging myself to solve problems and improve my coding skills.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of coding problems and puzzles that I've solved using various programming languages and techniques. These problems range in difficulty from simple exercises to more complex challenges that require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.

Each problem solution in this repository comes with a detailed explanation of the thought process that went into solving it. I believe that the best way to learn and grow as a developer is to understand the reasoning behind a solution, not just the solution itself. So, I've taken great care to provide step-by-step explanations of my thought process, including the various strategies and techniques that I've used.

In addition to the problem solutions, you'll also find notes and tips on general problem-solving strategies that I've found to be effective in my own practice. These tips range from how to approach a problem to how to stay focused and motivated during long coding sessions.

Whether you're a beginner just starting out in the world of programming or an experienced developer looking for new challenges, I hope that this repository will be a helpful resource for you. So feel free to explore, try out some of the problems, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Thanks for visiting my repository, and happy coding!
